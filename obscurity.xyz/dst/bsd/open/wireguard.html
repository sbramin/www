<p><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">wireguard</a> (wg) is a modern vpn protocol, using the latest class of encryption algorithms while at the same time promising speed and a small code base.</p>

<p>modern crypto and lean code are also tenants of openbsd, thus it was a no brainer to migrate my router from openvpn over to wireguard.</p>

<h2 id="my%20setup">my setup</h2>

<p>a collection of devices, both wired and wireless, that are nat&#8217;d through my router out via my vpn provider <a href="https://www.azirevpn.com/wireguard">azire*</a> and out to the internet using the wg-quick for starting wg.</p>

<pre><code>[wifi-ap] --------
                 |-- [switch] -- [router (wg-client)] -- [isp] -- [endpoint wg-server)] -- {the internet}
[wired-clients] --
</code></pre>

<p>install wireguard-go (the client/server) and wireguard-tools.</p>

<pre><code>~ doas pkg_add -v wireguard_tools wireguard-go
</code></pre>

<h3 id="pf.conf">pf.conf</h3>

<p>This is the simplest pf filei <em>/etc/pf.conf</em>, my wan interface is <strong>re0</strong>, my switch plugs into lan <strong>re2</strong> and wg will create the vpn interface <strong>tun0</strong>. The two important sections are <strong>max-mss 1360</strong> (more below on this) and the <strong>nat_to</strong> line on the vpn interface.</p>

<pre><code>lan = &quot;re2&quot;
wan = &quot;re0&quot;
vpn = &quot;tun0&quot;

table &lt;martians&gt; { 0.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.0/8 127.0.0.0/8 169.254.0.0/16 \

      192.168.0.0/16 198.18.0.0/15 198.51.100.0/24 \
      203.0.113.0/24 }

set block-policy drop

<h3 id="wg%20config">wg config</h3>

<p>if you are connecting to a wg endpoint you run, you will need to generate your public/private keys and use the relevant address/endpoint/dns settings, this is well documented in <a href="https://blog.jasper.la/wireguard-on-openbsd.html">jasper&#8217;s</a> article, oterhwise your provider should provide these eg. <a href="https://www.azirevpn.com/cfg/wireguard">azire&#8217;s</a> config generator. this file is stored in <em>/etc/wireguard/vpn.conf</em> (can name it anything you like, needs to end in .conf).</p>

<pre><code>[Interface]
PrivateKey = 5L+k............................+QOvXlU=
DNS = 192.211.0.2
Address = 10.0.0.42/19

[Peer]
PublicKey = xuxo8g............................qxTdfQ=
Endpoint = 149.248.160.60:51820
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0

</code></pre>

<h3 id="network%20settings">network settings</h3>

<p>this was the missing piece to get wg fully working, by default my outbound interface had an mtu of <em>1500</em> and <em>wg-quick</em> creates a tun device with an mtu of 80 bytes fewer, <em>1420</em>. i wasn&#8217;t able to find particular documentation as to why this is 80 bytes, instead of the usual 40/60 bytes a tcp header takes. at this point the router was able to use the wg connection perfectly, but the nat&#8217;d clients had issues connecting to particular sites. it was also necessary to set the <em>max</em>mss_ another 80 bytes lower than the tun0 mtu and <em>net.inet.tcp.mssdflt</em> to the same.</p>

<pre><code>~ doas sysctl net.inet.tcp.mssdflt=1360
# echo &#39;net.inet.tcp.mssdflt=1360&#39; &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>

<p>doubtless this could be improved on, but currently i start wg manually when my router boots. this, and the nat&#39;ing on the vpn interface mean its impossible for clients to connect to the internet without the vpn being up. as my router is on a ups and only reboots when a kernel patch requires it, it&#8217;s a compromise i can live with. run wg-quick (please replace <strong>vpn</strong> with whatever you named your wg <em>.conf</em> file.) and reload pf rules.</p>

<pre><code>~ doas wg-quick up vpn
~ doas pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
</code></pre>

<p><code>*</code> i am not affiliated with azire in anyway, just a happy customer, and they are supporters of the technology. doubtless other providers will also offer wg if they don&#8217;t already, or you can run your own as described in jasper&#8217;s article.</p>
